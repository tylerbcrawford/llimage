# Current Task Status

## Current Objectives
- Beginning Phase 2 development
- Setting up enhanced chart recognition capabilities
- Implementing OpenCV integration
- Establishing new project structure

## Context
Phase 1 (MVP) has been completed with:
- Working web interface
- Basic PDF processing capabilities
- Test PDFs for verification
- GitHub repository setup
- Complete documentation structure

Phase 2 is now beginning with focus on:
- Enhanced chart recognition
- Advanced image analysis
- Data extraction capabilities
- Structured output options

## Next Steps
1. Initial Phase 2 Setup
   - [x] Create new project structure
   - [x] Set up core package directory
   - [x] Initialize new module directories
   - [x] Update requirements.txt for OpenCV
   - [x] Create configuration files

2. OpenCV Integration
   - [x] Create image processing wrapper
   - [x] Set up basic image preprocessing
   - [x] Implement initial testing framework
   - [x] Test OpenCV installation and setup
   - [x] Verify OpenCV functionality with tests

3. Chart Detection Implementation
   - [x] Create chart detection module
   - [x] Implement basic shape detection
   - [x] Set up chart classification system
   - [x] Add initial chart type tests
   - [x] Test with real chart images
   - [ ] Refine detection algorithms:
     - [ ] Improve shape detection accuracy
     - [ ] Enhance chart type classification
