# Current Task Status

## Current Objectives
- Beginning Phase 2 development
- Setting up enhanced chart recognition capabilities
- Implementing OpenCV integration
- Establishing new project structure

## Context
Phase 1 (MVP) has been completed with:
- Working web interface
- Basic PDF processing capabilities
- Test PDFs for verification
- GitHub repository setup
- Complete documentation structure

Phase 2 is now beginning with focus on:
- Enhanced chart recognition
- Advanced image analysis
- Data extraction capabilities
- Structured output options

## Next Steps
1. Initial Phase 2 Setup
   - [ ] Create new project structure
   - [ ] Set up core package directory
   - [ ] Initialize new module directories
   - [ ] Update requirements.txt for OpenCV

2. OpenCV Integration
   - [ ] Install OpenCV dependencies
   - [ ] Create image processing wrapper
   - [ ] Set up basic image preprocessing
   - [ ] Implement initial testing framework

3. Chart Detection Implementation
   - [ ] Create chart detection module
   - [ ] Implement basic shape detection
   - [ ] Set up chart classification system
   - [ ] Add initial chart type tests

4. Development Infrastructure
   - [ ] Set up configuration system
   - [ ] Create logging framework
   - [ ] Establish testing patterns
   - [ ] Update documentation
