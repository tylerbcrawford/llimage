# Current Task Status

## Current Objectives
- Beginning Phase 2 development
- Setting up enhanced chart recognition capabilities
- Implementing OpenCV integration
- Establishing new project structure

## Context
Phase 1 (MVP) has been completed with:
- Working web interface
- Basic PDF processing capabilities
- Test PDFs for verification
- GitHub repository setup
- Complete documentation structure

Phase 2 is now beginning with focus on:
- Enhanced chart recognition
- Advanced image analysis
- Data extraction capabilities
- Structured output options

## Next Steps

   - [x] Update requirements.txt for OpenCV
   - [x] Create configuration files

2. OpenCV Integration
   - [x] Create image processing wrapper
   - [x] Set up basic image preprocessing
   - [x] Implement initial testing framework
   - [x] Test OpenCV installation and setup
   - [x] Verify OpenCV functionality with tests

3. Chart Detection Implementation
   - [x] Create chart detection module
   - [x] Implement basic shape detection
   - [x] Set up chart classification system
   - [x] Add initial chart type tests
   - [x] Test with real chart images
   - [x] Refine detection algorithms:
     - [x] Improve shape detection accuracy
     - [x] Enhance chart type classification
     - [x] Add support for basic shapes
     - [x] Implement better confidence scoring

4. Next Implementation Steps
