# Technology Stack

## Core Technologies

### Backend
- **Python 3.x**
  - Primary development language
  - Chosen for strong library support and ease of development

### Web Framework
- **Flask**
  - Lightweight web framework
  - Perfect for MVP development
  - Easy to extend as needed

### PDF Processing
- **pdfplumber**
  - Used for text extraction
  - Reliable PDF parsing capabilities

### OCR Technology
- **pytesseract**
  - OCR functionality for image processing
  - Requires Tesseract installation
- **pdf2image with poppler**
  - PDF to image conversion
  - Required for OCR processing

## Architecture Decisions

### Local Processing
- Decision: All processing done locally
- Rationale: Security and privacy concerns
- Impact: No external API dependencies

### Web Interface
- Decision: Simple Flask web app
- Rationale: Quick development, easy to use
- Impact: Minimal setup required for users

### File Processing
- Decision: Process PDFs in memory
- Rationale: Security and performance
- Impact: Limited by available system memory

### Storage
- Decision: Temporary file storage only
- Rationale: Privacy and security
- Impact: No persistent storage needed

## Dependencies
- Flask: Web framework
- pdfplumber: PDF text extraction
- pytesseract: OCR processing
- pdf2image: PDF conversion
- Tesseract: OCR engine (system requirement)
- Poppler: PDF rendering (system requirement)

## Development Tools
- Python virtual environment
- pytest for testing
- Git for version control
- GitHub for repository hosting

## System Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tesseract OCR
- Poppler utils
- Modern web browser

## Future Considerations
- Potential migration to async processing
- Database integration for result storage
- API development for external integration
- Container deployment options
